# System Libraries in Rtools40

R on Windows toolchain and package manager based on msys2.

## Installing Rtools4

Rtools40 does not conflict with other versions of Rtools and can be installed alongside existing Rtools 3.5 installations.

- Use [rtools40-x86_64.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40-x86_64.exe) on 64 bit Windows
- Use [rtools40-i686.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40-i686.exe) on 32 bit Windows

Rtools does not put itself on the PATH. You can add the following line to your `~/.Renviron` file (where `~` is your Documents folder by default) to help R find rtools when installing packages.

```
PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\usr\bin;${PATH}"
```

## System Libraries and pacman

Many R packages require external system libraries to build. Rtools4 includes a package manager called `pacman` which you can use to build and install system libraries provided via [rtools packages](https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-packages). The [`pacman` package manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman) has been ported from Arch Linux. Extensive documentation on how to use it is available from the [msys2 documentation](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-management/) and the [Arch Pacman webite](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman). 

To start using Rtools, open an Rtools bash shell via the Start Menu. There are 3 links in the to start menu to start a terminal, they only differ in which toolchain is put on the PATH. For most purposes it does not matter which shortcut you use.

This wil open a bash shell from where you can interact with the system. Try running `pacman --help` to get started:

```
>> pacman --help
usage:  pacman <operation> [...]
operations:
    pacman {-h --help}
    pacman {-V --version}
    pacman {-D --database} <options> <package(s)>
    pacman {-F --files}    [options] [package(s)]
    pacman {-Q --query}    [options] [package(s)]
    pacman {-R --remove}   [options] <package(s)>
    pacman {-S --sync}     [options] [package(s)]
    pacman {-T --deptest}  [options] [package(s)]
    pacman {-U --upgrade}  [options] <file(s)>

use 'pacman {-h --help}' with an operation for available options
```

The most important `pacman` command is `--sync` or for short: `-S`. This command is used to refresh the index of available packages, and install packages in your Rtools. Type `pacman -Sh` to show the manual page for the pacman sync command:

```
>> pacman -Sh
usage:  pacman {-S --sync} [options] [package(s)]
options:
  -b, --dbpath <path>  set an alternate database location
  -c, --clean          remove old packages from cache directory (-cc for all)
  -d, --nodeps         skip dependency version checks (-dd to skip all checks)
  -g, --groups         view all members of a package group
                       (-gg to view all groups and members)
  -i, --info           view package information (-ii for extended information)
  -l, --list <repo>    view a list of packages in a repo
  -p, --print          print the targets instead of performing the operation
  -q, --quiet          show less information for query and search
  -r, --root <path>    set an alternate installation root
  -s, --search <regex> search remote repositories for matching strings
  -u, --sysupgrade     upgrade installed packages (-uu enables downgrades)
  -v, --verbose        be verbose
  -w, --downloadonly   download packages but do not install/upgrade anything
  -y, --refresh        download fresh package databases from the server
                       (-yy to force a refresh even if up to date)
```

In your bash shell it looks something like this:

## Example: installing a library with pacman

Usually the first thing you want to do is run `pacman -Sy` which will refresh the package repository index from the server, so we know which packages are available:

```sh
# Update repo index
pacman -Sy
```

Let's try an example. Suppose you want to install the R package [fftwtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fftwtools) from source. Try to run the following in R (it won't succeed!):

```r
# Run this in R/RStudio
install.packages("fftwtools", type = 'source')
```

The compilation fails because this package requires a system library called [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/):

```
* installing *source* package 'fftwtools' ...
** package 'fftwtools' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
** using staged installation
** libs

*** arch - i386
"C:/rtools40/mingw32/bin/"gcc  -I"C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-4.0.0/include" -DNDEBUG          -O2 -Wall  -std=gnu99 -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -mstackrealign -c fftwtools.c -o fftwtools.o
fftwtools.c:28:9: fatal error: fftw3.h: No such file or directory
 #include<fftw3.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```

Go back to your Rtools bash shell and run the following `pacman` command to install fftw:

```sh
pacman -S  mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-fftw
```

This command installs 2 new system packages: `mingw-w64-i686-fftw` and `mingw-w64-x86_64-fftw`.

Now that the fftw system dependency is available, try again to install the R package using the same line from above! This time it works!

## Useful pacman commands

Use `pacman -Sl` to get a list of available packages that you can install. The list matches the [rtools-packages](https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-packages) repository on Github, where we maintain the build scripts. It is a pretty long list, that starts with something like this:

```
>> pacman -Sl
mingw32 mingw-w64-i686-argtable 2.13-1
mingw32 mingw-w64-i686-arrow 0.17.0-1
mingw32 mingw-w64-i686-binutils 2.33.1-1 [installed]
mingw32 mingw-w64-i686-boost 1.67.0-9002
mingw32 mingw-w64-i686-bwidget 1.9.12-1
mingw32 mingw-w64-i686-bzip2 1.0.8-1 [installed]

....
mingw64 mingw-w64-x86_64-argtable 2.13-1
mingw64 mingw-w64-x86_64-arrow 0.17.0-1
mingw64 mingw-w64-x86_64-binutils 2.33.1-1 [installed]
mingw64 mingw-w64-x86_64-boost 1.67.0-9002
mingw64 mingw-w64-x86_64-bwidget 1.9.12-1
mingw64 mingw-w64-x86_64-bzip2 1.0.8-1 [installed]
```

In rtools (or msys2) all packages are prefixed with `mingw-w64-i686-` for the 32-bit version and with `mingw-w64-x86_64-` for the 64-bit version. For building CRAN packages, we usually need both 32 and 64 bit..


Use `pacman -Su` to update all packages that you have installed already. This can be combined with `-y` which, as explained earlier, refreshes the repository index:

```
>> pacman -Syu
:: Synchronizing package databases...
 mingw32 is up to date
 mingw64 is up to date
```

You can add `--noconfirm` to any of the commands to skip the confirmation. This is useful for unattended installations.

Find out more at the [pacman website](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman).


## Compiling R packages with custom Flags

Some R packages do not use the correct flags by default and need a little help. You can pass additional compiler and linker flags by setting these environment variables:

 - `LOCAL_CPPFLAGS`: custom C/C++ flags passed when compiling
 - `LOCAL_LIBS`: custom flags when linking

This works for any R package. An example is the old `XML` package. First install `libxml2` in rtools:

```sh
# Run this in Rtools
pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-libxml2
```

And then install `XML` like this:

```r
# Run this in R
Sys.setenv(LOCAL_CPPFLAGS = "-I$(MINGW_PREFIX)/include/libxml2")
install.packages("XML", type = "source")
```

The `$(MINGW_PREFIX)` variable always refers to the root of the toolchain path, i.e. `/mingw32` when compiling for 32-bit and `/mingw64` when compiling for 64-bit.

## Building and contributing rtools packages

The readme file in the [r-windows/rtools-packages](https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-packages#readme) repository explains how to build your own system libraries, and possibly contribute them to rtools.


## Building base R

The same pacman libraries are used to build R packages are also used when building R itself! Have a look at the [r-windows/r-base](https://github.com/r-windows/r-base#readme) repository to see how we build R for Windows.


## Running a build server

If you run a winbuilder-like build server, it can be useful to install all the available system libraries from pacman, and keep them up-to-date. Obviously this takes a lot of space; regular users shouldn't do this!

The script below updates and installs __all packages from pacman__:

```sh
# Update packages !
pacman -Syu --noconfirm

# Careful! Installs ALL the pacman packages !!
pacman -S --needed --noconfirm $(pacman -Slq | grep mingw-w64-)
```
